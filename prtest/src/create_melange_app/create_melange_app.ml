(*
 * In OCaml, re-exporting a module allows you to make it available under a
 * new or existing module name within the current module's namespace. This is
 * similar to 'exporting' in JavaScript or TypeScript, where you can re-export
 * something from another module.
 *
 * In these lines, the modules `Configuration`, `Bundler`, and `Node_package_manager`
 * are being re-exported within the `Create_melange_app` module. This practice
 * makes each of these modules directly accessible as part of the current
 * module's namespace.
 *
 * This approach is beneficial in OCaml/Dune for structuring code more
 * clearly. It allows for creating well-defined module hierarchies and APIs, by
 * grouping related functionality and making it accessible under a unified
 * namespace. Such organization aids in maintaining clarity and ease of use in
 * larger codebases.
 *
 * In a Dune-managed project, each module corresponds to a file by default, so
 * this pattern is often used to expose certain modules at a higher level for
 * easier access by other parts of the application.
