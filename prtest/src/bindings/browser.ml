 * The following is syntax for creating bindings to JavaScript. This feature is
 * likely the most foreign that you will encounter in Melange and OCaml.
 * You can find extensive documentation on the subject here:
 * https://melange.re/v2.2.0/communicate-with-javascript/
 *
 * In the example below, we define two external bindings: `get_element_by_id`
 * and `set_inner_html`. These bindings allow us to interface directly with
 * JavaScript's DOM API in a type-safe manner using OCaml.
 *
 * - `[@@mel.scope "document"]` specifies the JavaScript object where the
 *   function is located, similar to specifying the object in JavaScript's dot
 *   notation.
 *
 * - `[@@mel.return nullable]` indicates that the return type from the JavaScript
 *   function can be `null`, mapped to OCaml's `option` type for safety.
 *
 * - The `external` keyword is used to declare a binding to a JavaScript
 *   function.
 *
 * - `get_element_by_id` is a binding to JavaScript's `getElementById` method.
 *
 * - `set_inner_html` is a binding to set the `innerHTML` property on a element.
 *
 * - In OCaml, external bindings respect JavaScript's naming conventions,
 *   hence the camelCase in the external declaration.
 *
 * These bindings enable direct interaction with the DOM in a way that feels
 * natural in OCaml while ensuring type safety and clarity.
 *
 * You can use the above bindings like so:
 *
 * let _ =
 *   "root"
 *   |> get_element_by_id
 *   |. set_inner_html "<p>hello world</p>"
 *
 * and it will generate the following JS:
 *
 * document.getElementById("root").innerHTML = "<p>hello world</p>";
 *
 * A quick note on `|>` and `|.`:
 *
 * - The `|>` operator is known as the 'pipe' operator. It is used to pass the
 *   result of the expression on the left side as the last argument to the
 *   function on the right side. This operator simplifies the code by allowing a
 *   more readable, left-to-right flow of data. For example, `x |> f` is
 *   equivalent to `f(x)`.
 *
 * - The `|.` operator, on the other hand, is a 'pipe first' operator. It is
 *   used to pass the value on the left as the first argument to the function on
 *   the right. This is particularly useful for chaining methods that expect the
 *   object they operate on to be the first argument, following the JavaScript
 *   method invocation pattern. For instance, `x |. g` effectively becomes
 *   `g(x)` in the JavaScript translation.
 *
 * These operators enhance the readability and functional style of OCaml
 * code, making it easier to follow the flow of data transformations.
