## Getting Started

Welcome to your `Melange` & `OCaml` app!

### Running your application

To run your application and start a dev server with hot module reloading, simply
run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Building your application

Building your application is as simple as running:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will handle running `Melange`'s build process and bundling your application
with `Vite`. Your bundled application and output will be located in `./dist`
after the build process completes.

## Your project layout

The following is a high level view of your project and application.
Many of these files will contain additional comments, explanations, examples,
and help for learning and getting started with `OCaml` and `Melange.`

## Installing OCaml packages

Installing OCaml packages is easy, but we have to use a separate
CLI ([for the time being](https://github.com/dmmulroy/create-melange-app/issues/61)). To install dependencies, we are
going to use `opam`, which is OCaml's package manager. You can
search for dependencies and packages on
[OCaml.org](https://ocaml.org/packages/search?q=).

There are [some requirements](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/whats-possible-with-melange/13806/3?u=dmmulroy) to use a package with `Melange` you should read
about. That being said, once you find a package you want to install you can
do the following steps:

1. Add the library to your `dune-project`'s `depends` section
2. Run the following commands

```sh
eval $(opam env) # This activates your local switch in your shell
dune build prtest.opam # This will regenerate your `opam` file
opam update # This will ensure `opam` can see the most recent versions of packages
opam install . --deps-only --yes # This will install your new packages
```
